# Historic SpiderMonkey Releases

This section of Github is dedicated to Mozilla SpiderMonkey and all the fine hackers who have contributed to the engine over the years. 

The 1.4.2 - 1.8.0 repositories were created from the official release tarballs. If you have any earlier releases, I would be delighted to the host them here.
The 1.8.5 repository was created by importing the mercurial repository I used to cut the official libmozjs185 release tarball. I believe that work was originally done on BitBucket but not folded back into mozilla-central since (at the time) the build required minor tweaks to create libmozjs185.so, and these tweaks were not compatible with the needs of the core team.
